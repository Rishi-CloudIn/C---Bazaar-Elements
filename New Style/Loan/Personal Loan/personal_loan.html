      <h5 class="h4 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">Low Interest Rate Loan Offers in India:</h5>
      <p class="fs-6">The dictionary defines a loan as thus, ‘a thing that is borrowed, especially a sum of money that is expected to be paid back with interest’ and rightfully so, our entire civilization is built on the concepts of loaning and paying back. In modern day India, the middle class has emerged as an average marketer’s dream target, the playground for companies that deal in consumer products and consequently, the numero uno customer for the massively available loans. From homes to education, vehicles to vacations, if there is an expenditure angle involved, then there is a loan for it.<br/>
        <br/>
      In terms of sheer volume and popularity, the banks have segregated the concept of loaning into various types. There is the <a href="#">personal loan</a>, and as its name so aptly suggests, is an influx of monies that the receiver can use for whatever personal requirement or monetary contingency that he/she might have. Not surprisingly, a  <a href="#">home loan</a> and  <a href="#">car loan</a> is intended for the purchase of a home and a car respectively, while an <a href="#">education loan</a>  helps the borrower cope with the high prices for a competent education these days. In India, almost all private and public sector banks count the aforementioned loan products as a hot commodity in their respective portfolios and competition is ripe to attract a prospective customer’s undivided attention. From varying interest rates to relaxed loan tenures, poaching strategies like the concept of home loan transfer- the shifting of home loan from one lender to another who offers a lower interest rate, to heavy discounts and offers, the string of available loan options are many.
      How can anybody discriminate between these available choices? Explore, Credit Bazaar.com.

      <!-- --------MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate)-------- -->

      <h5 class="h4 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate)</h5>

      <p class="fs-6">Individuals who have availed loans from lenders or banks before 1 April, 2016 will be paying the base rate and not MCLR. MCLR or marginal cost of funds based lending rate, when compared to the base rate compared, is seen to be lower by 5 to 50 basis points. This happens as the marginal cost of funds based lending rate is closely linked with the repo rate. Thus, there is better transmission of Reserve Bank of India’s rate cut to the borrower.

      <h5 class="h4 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">What is MCLR?</h5>
      <p class="fs-6">The MCLR is a reference rate or internal benchmark for the financial institution. Marginal cost of funds based lending rate defines the process used to determine the <a href="#"> minimum home loan rate of interest. </a> The MCLR method was introduced in the Indian financial system by the Reserve Bank of India in the year 2016. The MCLR system has replaced the base rate system that was introduced in the year 2010. Thus, renewal of credit limits and sanctioning of loans is done as per MCLR norms.

      <p class="fs-6">MCLR (marginal cost of funds based lending rate) is the lowest interest rate that a bank or lender can offer. Most banks cannot offer interest rates lower than the marginal cost of funds based lending rate. However, certain exceptions can be made when allowed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

      <!-- --------What Is MCLR Rate In Home Loan?-------- -->

      <h5 class="h4 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">What Is MCLR Rate In Home Loan?</h5>
      <p class="fs-6">MCLR is closely linked with the repo rate and fund costs of the banks. Thus, if there is a change in the repo rate, it will have an impact on your home loan’s floating rate of interest. If a bank brings down the marginal cost of funds based lending rate, the floating rate of interest associated with your home loan also comes down. This will not be affecting your <a href="#">equated monthly installments </a>  but the tenure of the loan will get impacted.

      <!-- --------How to calculate MCLR?------- -->


      <h5 class="h4 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">How to calculate MCLR?</h5>

      <p class="fs-6">In order to calculate the marginal cost of funds based lending rate, you must consider all the borrowing sources for a bank. A bank borrows from several sources including,<a href="#"> fixed deposit</a>, current accounts, savings accounts, etc. The rate of interest in these borrowing sources can be used by you for the calculation of marginal borrowing cost. You must understand that the source of a bank’s funds is not only borrowing, but also the equity (retained or infused earnings). Thus, return on equity can also be expected.
        <br/>
      The formula prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India for calculation of MCLR is given below:

      </p>  


      <!-- --------Marginal cost of funds = Marginal borrowing cost x 92% + return on the net worth x 8%------- -->


      <h5 class="h4 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">Marginal cost of funds = Marginal borrowing cost x 92% + return on the net worth x 8%</h5>

      <p class="fs-6">Banks must also maintain a cash reserve ratio of 4%. On this deposit, no interest is earned by the bank. Under MCLR, banks can avail some allowance called Negative Carry on CRR. Also, the operating costs must be considered and taken care of. There are several expenses of a bank that includes raising funds, opening branches, paying salary to its employees etc. These are not charged to the customers. Finally comes the discount or tenor premium. The reset period for the interest rate is called the tenor. It is directly proportional to the reset period i.e. the tenor is higher if the reset period is higher.
      </p>

      <!-- --------How To Convert Base Rate Home Loan To MCLR?------- -->


      <h5 class="h4 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">How To Convert Base Rate Home Loan To MCLR?</h5>
      <p class="fs-6">The decision to switch to MCLR from base rate depends majorly on the actual benefits and the transfer cost. Various banks charge differently for this switch. However, there are certain banks that allow you to <span class="h6">convert a home loan to MCLR</span> without charging anything.
        <br/>
        <br/>
      <span class="h6">Example: </span>Consider you have borrowed an amount of Rs.40 lakh as home loan and you intend to repay it over a tenure of 20 years. The base associated with your home loan stands at 9.95%. After a period of three years from the commencement of the loan tenure, you would have paid an amount of Rs.38,468 as your monthly installments. You have also paid an interest amount of Rs.11,63,514. If you choose to continue on the same path with your base rate, you will be paying a total interest of Rs.52,32,428. However, if you choose you switch to MCLR for your home loan at 8.55% for the remaining tenure (17 years in this case), you will be paying an interest of Rs.34,00,396. This is the amount that you pay for 17 years. So, the total interest that you pay for your home loan is (Rs.11,63,514 + Rs.34,00,396) which comes up to Rs.45,63,910. It shows that you save a substantial amount of Rs.6,68,518 by switching to MCLR from base rate

      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Personal Loan Interest Rates</h5>
      <p class="fs-6">The <a href="#">personal loan interest rates </a> vary between 8.30% p.a. and 49% p.a. Depending on the loan amount availed by you, your credit score, and repayment tenure, the interest rate charged on your loan is decided.

      </p>

      <!-- ------Uses of Personal Loan------- -->

      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Uses of Personal Loan</h5>
      <p class="fs-6">What can you use a personal loan for? Since it is an unsecured loan without the need for any collateral, there are very few limitations on how you can use a personal loan. It can broadly be used for consolidating your debt (from other loans or <a href="#">credit cards</a>), making high-value purchases for which you do not have cash in hand, or for emergency situations. It cannot be used for speculative purposes or for making investments in the stock market. Some of the common reasons that people take out personal loans for includes meeting sudden business or educational expenses, paying for a vacation, buying high-end electronic gadgets or household appliances, wedding expenses, emergency medical expenses, home renovations, etc. It can also be used for buying a vehicle if the rate of interest on the personal loan is lower than that of a vehicle loan. Thus, a personal loan has a wide variety of uses and can come in handy for meeting either planned or emergency expenditure.

      <!-- --------------Pre-Payment and Part Payment in Personal Loan-------------- -->

      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Pre-Payment and Part Payment in Personal Loan</h5> 
      <p class="fs-6">A personal loan is given for a stipulated time period. This period is known as the loan repayment tenure. After you have taken a loan, you are expected to pay the debt off by the end of the loan repayment tenure through EMIs. However, after availing a loan, if you decide to pay off your debt before the end of the loan repayment period, it is called pre-payment or foreclosure.</p>

      <h6 class="h5 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Types of Pre-Payment:</h6> 

      <p class="fs-6">There are 2 types of pre-payment. They are full pre-payment and part pre-payment and part payment.
      </p>
     
      <h6 class="h5 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder"> 1. Full Pre-Payment:</h6> 
      <p class="fs-6">If you are paying off the whole outstanding loan amount before the end of the loan repayment tenure, it is known as full pre-payment.
      </p>

      <h6 class="h6 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Advantages of full pre-payment:</h6> 
      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="h6">You can avoid paying hefty interest on your loan amount.</li>
        <li class="h6">If you have the money to pay off your debt completely, you might as well get rid of the debt.</li>
        <li class="h6">You can avoid paying pre-payment interest as well, if you have taken the loan from a lender who does not charge an interest on pre-payment of the loan.</li>
      </ul> 

      <h6 class="h6 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Disadvantages of Full Pre-Payment:</h6> 
      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="h6">If your lender charges a penalty on pre-payment of the loan amount, you might have to pay a big chunk of money for pre-paying your loan.</li>
        <li class="h6">Before you foreclose a loan, check the other factors related to it. Foreclosing a personal loan means that you would be paying out a huge sum of money at once. This might not always be the best option.</li>
      </ul> 



      <!-- --------------Part pre-payment:-------------- -->


      <h6 class="h5 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">2. Part pre-payment:</h6> 
      <p class="fs-6">If you are paying off a part of the outstanding loan amount before the end of the loan repayment tenure, it is known as part pre-payment</p>

      <h6 class="h6 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">Advantages of part pre-payment:</h6> 
      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="h6">You can choose to pay off a part of your outstanding loan amount if you have some readily available money.</li>
        <li class="h6">Part paying your loan will reduce the outstanding principal amount which, in turn, will reduce the effective EMI amount.</li>
        <li class="h6">The overall interest that you pay will also reduce significantly.</li>
      </ul> 

      <h6 class="h6 mt-4 mb-2 fw-bolder">Disadvantages of part pre-payment:</h6> 
      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="h6">If you do not make the part payment soon enough, you will not be able to maximize your savings.</li>
        <li class="h6">If your lender charges a fee for <a href="#">part payment of personal loans</a> , you might have to spend a significant amount of money for the same.</li>
      </ul> 


      <!-- --------------Modes of Loan Payment or Repayment-------------- -->


      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Modes of Loan Payment or Repayment</h5> 
      <p class="fs-6">There are a number of repayment modes which are offered by lenders. Although these modes might differ from lender to lender, the most common modes of repayment can be summed up as follows:</p>

      <div>
        <p class="fs-6"><span class="h6">1. Electronic Clearance System (ECS):</span> The ECS or Electronic Clearance System is one of the most commonly used repayment methods. It is an electronic mode through which funds are transferred from one bank to another.</p>
        <p class="fs-6"><span class="h6">2. Post Dated Cheques (PDCs):</span> Post Dated Cheques, as the name suggests, are cheques which are issued by you for a future date. The lender will use these cheques on the mentioned date to deposit or encash the amount mentioned on it.</p>
        <p class="fs-6"><span class="h6">3. National Automated Clearing House:</span>The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) offers a program called NACH to all the banks and financial institutions. The NACH allows the processing of transactions in real time. This method can be used for your loan repayments.</p>
        <p class="fs-6"><span class="h6">4. Debit mandate or standing instruction:</span> You can give an instruction to your bank to pay off a particular amount of money to another bank or bank account at a regular interval. This is known as standing instruction or debit mandate. Your bank will be paying off the stipulated amount towards the repayment of your loan on a regular basis through this system.</p>

      <!-- --------------How to Improve your Chances of Getting a Personal Loan?-------------- -->

      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">How to Improve your Chances of Getting a Personal Loan?</h5> 

      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="fs-6"><span class="h6">Credit Clean-up: </span>One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li>

        <li class="fs-6"><span class="h6">Rebalancing your income and debts: </span>Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a loan.</li>

        <li class="fs-6"><span class="h6">Consider Co-signers/Guarantors: </span> If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li>

        <li class="fs-6"><span class="h6">Limit Your Borrowing: </span>It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li>

        <li class="fs-6"><span class="h6">Choose the Right Lender: </span> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will <a href="#">check your credit score</a>, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li>
      </ul>
  

      <!-- --------------How to Avoid Rejection of Personal Loan Applications?-------------- -->



      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">How to Avoid Rejection of Personal Loan Applications?</h5>

      <!-- --------------Things to do After Closing a Personal Loan-------------- -->

      <h5 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2 fw-bolder">Things to do After Closing a Personal Loan</h5> 
      <p class="fs-6">If you have recently paid off your personal loan (either repaid or foreclosed), you might have the idea that your obligation towards the loan is over. However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p>  

      <ul class="mt-3">
        <li class="fs-6 mt-2"><span class="h6">No Dues Certificate (NDC):</span>The No Dues Certificate (NDC) is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document, you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li>

        <li class="fs-6 mt-2"><span class="h6">Statement of Account (SoA):</span>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li>

        <li class="fs-6 mt-2"><span class="h6">Collection of unused cheques:</span>If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li>

        <li class="fs-6 mt-2"><span class="h6">Check your credit score after closing the loan:</span>This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li>
      </ul>

This was also the first time the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased the repo rate on an unplanned basis. The decision was made to keep inflation under control, which has been persistently over the target of 6% for the previous three months.
          The RBI's action, however, would have an impact on people who have borrowed house loans and vehicle loans. Meanwhile, the MPC, led by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, increased the amount of deposits required by banks to keep a cash reserve by 50 basis points to 4.5% in order to extract Rs.87,000 crore of liquidity from the banking sector. The CRR increase will take effect on 21 May.
